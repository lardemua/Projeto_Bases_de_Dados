abstract = {An AI System for obtaining the magnitude of process parameters in plastic injection molding operation has been developed. The system is user interactive and can be used at shop floor. This system applies two techniques, Rule-Based and Case-Based Reasoning. Case-Based Reasoning is used to derived the first trial setting of processing parameters, while the Rule-Based sub-system suggests a set of corrective actions to deal with possible corresponding variations in molding. The system reduces optimization time and human expert dependency.},

@article{Yan2009,
abstract = {Micro-cutting experiments were conducted on electroless-plated nickel phosphorous (NiP) surfaces to fabricate microstructures such as microgrooves and micropyramid arrays. Burr formation behavior and cutting force characteristics were investigated experimentally and simulated by the finite element method (FEM) under various conditions. A simple two-step cutting process was proposed to improve the surface quality. The machined microstructure arrays were used as molds for hot-press glass molding experiments and good geometrical transferability was confirmed. The results from this study verify that diamond-machined NiP microstructure molds are applicable to glass molding processes for mass production of precision micro-mechanical and optical components.},

@article{Trovant1998,
abstract = {The formation of the air gap at the mold⧹metal interface during casting is responsible for considerable changes in local cooling rates. Often, boundary conditions input to a mathematical model have routinely been guessed at (often inaccurately) or have been determined experimentally, both of which can introduce difficulties in predicting solidification history. A novel technique which minimizes the error associated with selecting boundary conditions without experimentation is proposed. Advance knowledge of air gap formation and its correlation to the heat transfer coefficient at the mold⧹metal interface is used to formulate a coupled mathematical model which determines the growth of the air gap and predicts the instantaneous cooling conditions at a given mold wall. The accuracy of the simulation is consequently improved and the need to match experimental boundary conditions is eliminated. This paper presents the current results of an ongoing research program. {\textcopyright} 1998 Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.},

abstract = {Injection molding is the most widely used process in manufacturing plastic products. Since the quality of injection molded plastic parts are mostly influenced by process conditions, how to determine the optimum process conditions becomes the key to improving the part quality. In this paper, a combining artificial neural network and genetic algorithm (ANN/GA) method is proposed to optimize the injection molding process. In this method, a BP neural network model is developed to map the complex non-linear relationship between process conditions and quality indexes of the injection molded parts, and a GA is used in the process conditions optimization with the fitness function based on an ANN model. The combining ANN/GA method is used in the process optimization for an industrial part in order to improve the quality index of the volumetric shrinkage variation in the part. The results show that the combining ANN/GA method is an effective tool for the process optimization of injection molding. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this study, the cell thin shell phone cover produced with polycarbonate/acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (PC/ABS) thermoplastic were decided as a model. First, the effects of the injection parameters on warpage for different thickness values were examined using Taguchi method. The warpage values were found by analyses which were done by moldflow plastic insight (MPI) 4.0 software. The most influential parameter on the warpage of PC/ABS material was found as packing pressure. Second, to determine the forces that cause the plastic part to fail at the points determined over the top surface of the cell phone cover, CATIA V5R12 (general structural analysis) was used. The structural analysis of ABS, PC, reinforced ABS, reinforced PC/ABS thermoplastic materials in addition to PC/ABS material used in telephone manufacture were done in order to determine the performance. When we look at the structural analysis, the strongest materials are 15{\%} carbon fiber reinforced PC/ABS, 15{\%} carbon fiber reinforced ABS, PC, PC/ABS and ABS, respectively. The most critical point on the top surface of the cell phone is point 2},
