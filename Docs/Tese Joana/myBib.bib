	Abstract = {Laminated ballistic composite panels are an important part of hard-plate protective body armour and may be subjected to a wide variety of impact conditions depending on the projectile, impact velocity and armour construction, to name a few.
The ballistic response of laminated composite panels has been investigated through direct impacts of two non-deforming projectiles (7.5mm diameter hardened steel 1201 cylindrical--conical, and 9mm hemispherical nosed) selected to enhance different failure mechanisms including penetration and delamination.
Experimental and numerical studies were carried out to determine the ballistic response of laminated Kevlars 29 and 129 composite panels, commonly used in protective body armour. These panels were impacted at velocities between 130 and 250 m/s, which were below the penetration limit of the panels.
A numerical parametric study was initially undertaken to determine those material properties which reduce back face signature (BFS; maximum dynamic displacement), one of the important performance indicators for assessing personal protection. Experimental material characterization then allowed mechanical property data to be determined for numerical simulations, which showed good agreement with the experimental data, particularly for the conical projectile impacts on both types of Kevlars panels.
Numerical simulations of the impact tests accurately predicted the BFS and dynamic response for the conical projectile impacts, while the BFS for the hemispherical projectiles was slightly low. This can be attributed to the dominant delamination failure mechanisms, which may not be completely captured by the numerical model. Importantly, the numerical analysis accurately predicted the initial velocity of the panel back face for the hemispherical projectiles and the time to reach maximum BFS for the conical projectiles.},

	Abstract = {This paper may be the first trial regarding the optimal design of a multi-layered plate under ballistic impact. An opti- mal design of a multi-layered plate to endure ballistic impact is suggested by using size optimization based on numerical simulations. The NET2D, a Lagrangian explicit time-integration finite element code for impact analyses, is used to find the optimal parameter values. Three different materials such as mild steel and aluminum for a multi-layered plate struc- ture and die steel for the pellet are assumed. In order to consider the effects of strain rate hardening, strain hardening and thermal softening, the Johnson--Cook model is used as the constitutive models for the simulation. Several mesh types of different size and aspect ratio are tried to check the effect of mesh on the solution and to obtain the appropriate mesh density. The measuring domain is selected to reduce the analyzing time without affecting the sensitivity.
The response surface method based on the design of experiments is used to obtain the optimal design. The average temperature or the equivalent plastic strain is introduced as a response for the optimization of the impact problem. Fur- thermore, the perforation criteria with the equivalent plastic strain to determine whether the plate structure is perfo- rated or not is suggested. The optimized thickness of each layer in which perforation does not occur and the strength of multi-layer is maximized is obtained at a constant velocity of a pellet with a designated total thickness.},

	Abstract = {When a long-rod projectile penetrates a thick target with an angle of attack, interfering of the projectile with the sidewall of a crater is the mechanism for the degraded penetration performance. By using an engineering model, signi"cant parameters and how they vary over a wide velocity range can be quickly obtained. A transient discreet impact model is developed to predict not only the crater pro"le but "nal depth generated by the penetration of a yawed long rod. The yawed long rod is described as a series of continuous "nite disk elements which enables us to keep revising the time-dependent crater pro"le. To consider the interaction with the crater sidewall, e!ective diameters for each element are used, and the revised crater pro"le is calculated based on these e!ective diameters. Three possibilities of the degree of degradation in penetration for the elements that interact with crater sidewall are discussed. The model reduces, in the case of the impact with no yaw, to the Alekseevskii Tate's solution. Theoretical predictions are compared with the corresponding experimental data.},

This evaluation was carried out using the Empirical Bayes method with a comparison group. The functioning of a methodology to test the significance of the safety impact is described. The results show that highway upgrading has a positive and significant safety impact, while the updating and improvement of traffic signing, the repainting of road markings and pavement resurfacings do not exhibit a significant impact on safety.},

@article{Schafer2006a,
	Abstract = {In this paper, an engineering fragmentation model is presented for the case of hypervelocity impact of a spherical projectile on a thin bumper plate at normal incidence. The range of impact velocities covered is the solid fragmentation regime up to the limits of complete melting of projectile and target material. The model was developed for an axisymmetric fragment cloud by consideration of the conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy, as well as making a few assumptions on the morphology of the cloud. The fragment cloud is modeled discretely, i.e. each particle of the fragment cloud is considered separately in the analytical calculation. The model consists of mainly analytical relationships and a few empirical fit functions, where no analytical formulation was available. The model distinguishes between fragments originating from the projectile and fragments originating from the bumper plate. The projectile fragments are split into the central fragment and spall fragments. An exponential distribution function is assumed for the mass distribution of the projectile's spall fragments. The fragments from the bumper are assumed to have a uniform mass. All fragments are assumed to be of spherical shape. The fragmentation model was applied and calibrated during experiments, in which Al spheres impact on thin Al plates. The calibration experiments, performed using a two-stage light gas gun, were in the range of impact velocities between 4.8 and 6.7 km/s. In this velocity range, the model was calibrated against residual velocities measured and fragment mass distribution, which was indirectly determined by measuring the crater depth distributions in rear walls.},
